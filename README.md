## The following repository contains the following games, which are made using C++ programming:
note: These games were a part of tasks assigned by InternPe

### 1. Number Guessing Game 
An engaging number guessing game is created where players try to guess a randomly 
generated number. This project showcases the fundamentals of C++ programming, including random 
number generation, loops, and user input handling. Also, I've added hints to keep people enjoying the 
game and not to make them leave out of frustration. You can also question your instincts by getting the 
number of guesses you made to identify the random number. 
### 2. Rock-Paper-Scissors
We implemented the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in this task. The Rock
Paper-Scissors game implemented in C++ is an interactive console-based program that allows users to 
play 
against the computer. The game utilizes a class-based structure, where the 
(RockPaperScissorsGame) class manages game logic, user input, and result determination. The 
available choices—rock, paper, and scissors—are stored in a vector, and user input is converted to 
lowercase for consistency. The program ensures valid user input and generates a random choice for the 
computer using the <random> library. The winner is determined based on standard Rock-Paper
Scissors rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both the player and the 
computer choose the same option, the game results in a tie. The game runs in a loop until the player 
loses, at which point a message is displayed thanking them for playing. The implementation makes use 
of C++ Standard Template Library (STL) features like vectors, string manipulation, and random 
number generation to create an engaging and fair gameplay experience.
### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe Advance
A classic game, implementing key C++ concepts like functions, arrays, and control 
structures to manage game logic, validate moves, and determine winners BUT with a twist! 
I made this game dynamic and more challenging to the users in such a way that whenever the game 
ties, the board size increases and hence increasing the difficulty level until there's a winner! 
This project was a fantastic way to practice my coding skills and deepen my understanding of C++ 
fundamentals.
### 4. Connect Four
The Connect Four game implemented in C++ is an interactive console-based game that allows players 
to compete against each other or against the computer. The game is played on a 6x7 grid where 
players take turns dropping their respective pieces (‘X’ for Player 1 and ‘O’ for Player 2 or the 
computer) into one of the seven columns. The game follows a structured approach, utilizing a 2D 
vector to represent the board and implementing functions for printing the board, validating moves, 
making moves, and checking for a win or tie. The program includes both Player vs. Player and Player 
vs. Computer modes, with the computer making moves based on random selection from valid 
columns. A player wins when they connect four of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or 
diagonal. The game also features a menu system allowing players to replay, switch game modes, or 
quit. Error handling ensures valid input, preventing incorrect moves or invalid column selections. By 
leveraging C++ Standard Template Library (STL) features and a structured game loop, the program 
delivers an engaging gameplay experience with strategic depth and replay ability
